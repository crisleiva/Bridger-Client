## Restless Recorder

Restless Recorder is an app for recording your anxiety levels.

**There is a lack of diagnostic tools for people to be aware of their anxiety levels and patterns. We feel that there are a lot of young adults in their 20s and 30s who want to take control of their anxiety and would like some better tools. This app is designed to help fill that gap and assist people who are looking to take action to gain better awareness and potential control of their anxiety.**

While not a total solution to anxiety in itself, with the data from the app, the user and/or user's physician can view the data for help with diagnosis. Specifically, the user can become more self-aware about what make them anxious and when they are likely to become anxious.

### How it works

Users sign into Restless Recorder. From here once their account is made they are encouraged to make daily logs about their anxiety. The form they fill out is simple and easy to use to encourage them to keep using it. First and foremost, they write down their biggest cause of anxiety for that day, followed by a numerical value (1-10) to help describe the intensity of that anxiety. From day to day they will be able to select this cause of anxiety again and keep assigning it new values. These values are tracked over time so they can make note of these changes. The user may also add a new cause of anxiety if there is a larger cause of anxiety for that day. The values of that cause will also be tracked from that point forward.

In order to account for external factors, the user also inputs values for their satisfaction of their previous night's sleep, their diet for that day as well as their amount of social activity. This is so they may look over that data and cross-analyze it with their anxiety patterns.

### Developement

Restless Recorder is built with React and a Rails API backend.
